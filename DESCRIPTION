Description: An implementation of functionalities to transform directed graphs that are bound to a set of
  known forbidden paths. There are several transformations, following the rules provided by Villeneuve 
  and Desaulniers (2005), and Hsu et al. (2009). The resulting graph is generated in a data-frame format. See
  R-SPPFP website for more information, documentation an examples.
