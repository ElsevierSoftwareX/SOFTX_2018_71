\title{Undirected Graph Translator}
\usage{
direct_graph(graph, cores = 1L)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{An undirected graph written as a data frame, in which each rows represent an arc. The columns
must be named \code{from} and \code{to}, and can be of any data type. Each row can have additional
attributes, and no cells can be \code{NULL} or \code{NA}.}

\item{cores}{This algorithm can be run using R's parallel processing functions. This variable represents
the number of processing cores you want to assign for the transformation. The default value is one single
core. It is suggested to not assign all of your available cores to the function.}
}
\value{
A new graph, with the same columns and data types of the original graph. This new graph is twice as
   big as the original, as new arcs are added to represent that each arc can be traveled in both directions.
}
\description{
The SPPFP transformation functions only work with digraphs -i.e. directed graphs. Because in a digraph
   arcs can only be traveled in one direction, from the origin node to the destination arc, if undirected graphs are
   used as-is, the resultng G* will not be accurate. Therefore, this functions translates an undirected graph to a
   digraph by duplicating each arc and swapping the duplicate's \code{from} and \code{to} nodes.

\examples{
# Obtain the graph from any way
undirected_graph <- read.csv(...)

# Translate it
digraph <- direct_graph(undirected_graph)
